This is a code repository for code assessment with GotoCourse, an Edtech platform. 

This is always an ongoing project as the backend is not fully functional and would definitely need to be worked on in the future.

So far, the stack used includes: React, MongoDB, Node.js and Express.js.

Live Project is hosted here:https://goto-course.vercel.app/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
